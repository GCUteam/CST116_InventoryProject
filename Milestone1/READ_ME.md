Hello Classmates,
I am posting this here even though it is not necessary for the assignment so you all can see what I will be writing for my submission. I am not entirely sure if this is correct however that is what I am going for. If you would like you can all add you contributions here to the read me and what you expect to contribute along the way. I look foward to working with all of you!

My Contributions thus far have been set up of the Git Repository and gathering of the grou. Going on I would also like to assume the responsibility of creating the code for finding customer data as well as updating it. I will also be contributing with the overall organization of the Requirements Documents as well as filling it out and keeping it up to date as we progress.
