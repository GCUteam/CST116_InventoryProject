This week I worked on establishing the code that would prompt errors when the wrong input was made in places
like the username and password fields as well as customer ID. I also established an inventory system via an access database
that will be added to the code with the ability to choose. I am working to get it functioning however I ran into a bump with
visual basics prompting an error when I try import the database. i will look further into the issue and have it repaired and
working for next week.
