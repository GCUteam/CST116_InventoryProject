Milestone 5 - Database
During the Milestone 5 assignment to add a database to the software I worked with Crystal and Dennis in order to 
join our interface pieces. I also built multiple demo databases in order to try to figure out the best option for
our software. Still trying to figure out the best way to merge our interfaces and trying to figure out how to 
utilize databases throughout the finished software.
