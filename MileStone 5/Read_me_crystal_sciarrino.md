This week my job was mostly going in depth in creating a database that had all the seperate parts that we needed.However,
due to some errors I was unable to access the database. I made one on my own but it was not implemented into the code we 
submitted for this week so I am hoping to fix it all as soon as possible. I started to assignment over to clean up the coding
and overall flow of the code placement. Working in a team is difficult for me and I really needed to have a taste of what it
can be like in a real situation. I am quite positive our group has struggled across the board with this project so I am hoping
everything comes together at the end.
