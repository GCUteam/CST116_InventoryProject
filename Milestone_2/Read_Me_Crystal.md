Milestone 2
This week I worked with my team to establish a much better work flow.
After one of my classmates came up with a preliminary flow chart I
revised it to fit a more functional and understandable set up. In the
flow chart I implemented a legend that explains the arrows and connection
types as well as the different colors of the text boxes. In the lines 
connecting each function menu I put some basic function notes showing
what and how certian function were implemented.
